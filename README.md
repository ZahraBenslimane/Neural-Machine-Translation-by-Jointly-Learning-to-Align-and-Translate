# Neural-Machine-Translation-by-Jointly-Learning-to-Align-and-Translate
Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance.
